Here is the step by step Implementation of the app:

1. Setting Up the Environment:
-Install the required libraries: pandas, re, libraries from langchain_* (for text generation), docx (for document creation), and Flask (for web application). You can typically use pip install <library_name> for each library.

2. Web Application with Flask:
-Created a Flask application instance to handle user interactions and generate the report.

3. Loading the Generative AI Model:
-Used the ChatOllama class to instantiate a pre-trained large language model (LLM) named "wizardlm2" for text generation.

4. Defining Prompts for Text Generation:
-Created prompts using ChatPromptTemplate to guide the LLM in generating content for different sections of the report.

5. User Input and Processing:
-Developed a mechanism to collect user input, typically through a web form. This input will be the name of the item for which the report needs to be generated.

6. Generating Text Content with LLM:
-Used the LLM model ("wizardlm2") with the appropriate prompt (based on the report section) to generate content for each section.
-The model will receive the user-provided item name ({question}) within the prompt and generate detailed content for each subheading.

7. Parsing and Structuring Generated Text:
-Implemented functions to parse the text generated by the LLM and extract relevant information for each section of the report.
-Separated sections containing tables from plain text sections.

8. Creating the Document with Docx:
-Create a new document using the Document class from the docx library.
-Generate tables for sections containing tabular data extracted from the LLM output.
-Define table structure with headers and columns.
-Populate table cells with the extracted data.
-Add headings and paragraphs for sections containing plain text.

9. Saving and Downloading the Document:
-Save the complete document as a Microsoft Word (.docx) file with an appropriate name.
-Implemented a mechanism in Flask application to allow the user to download the generated report.

10. Running the Application:
-Run the Flask application using the app.run(debug=True) command (or similar) to start the web server. This will typically make the application accessible on your local machine at a specific port (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
-Access the application in your web browser, enter the item name, and submit the form. The application will generate the document and provide a download link.
